# Coder Newbie Advice

## About this project

Coder Newbie started as a small project with a repository of files and has since evolved into a useful reference with free resources provided for aspiring coders. We need more diversity in tech and so often the blockers are lack of information and money. I hope this can help make a positive change for our industry, because we need greater diversity to create better software.

It has subsequently been turned into an awesome [website](http://coder-newbie.surge.sh).
